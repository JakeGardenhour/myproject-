Leave an empty line between headings and paragraphs.

Font can be *Italic* or **Bold**.

Citing your work is important! [^1]

Title sections of your essay with headings, by adding a pound sign (`#`) in front of the title:

# Heading One

## Heading Two

### Heading Three, etc.

A numbered list is created using a number + `.`, like:

1. one
2. two
6. three
2. four

A horizontal line break can be useful for separating content:
